Abstract
---

Groundwater contributions are a critical component to global streamflow generation. In mountainous regions, the importance of subsurface storage for maintaining alpine streamflow (i.e., headwater stream networks) is increasingly clear; however, knowledge gaps regarding the seasonal dynamics of mountain groundwater systems and how groundwater contributions to streamflow change over space and time still persist. Radon-222 is a powerful tool for identifying groundwater inputs to streamflow, especially when used in combination with other geochemical parameters.

Sagehen Creek Basin (CA) is a small (27 km<sup>2</sup>), snowmelt-dominated catchment in the north-central Sierra Nevada hosting a stream network largely supported by decadal groundwater, even during peak streamflow. We collected biweekly stream samples at 10 sites along a longitudinal profile of the main stem of Sagehen Creek from the headwaters to the outlet at the USGS stream gauge. We measured radon-222 and water stable isotopes and measured field geochemical parameters (SPC, temperature, pH) at each site. Our sampling season extends from May 2024 to October 2024, a temporal window that spans from peak streamflow (i.e., snowmelt) to baseflow. In addition, we collected samples from groundwater springs emerging across a range of elevations and geologic media to characterize the radon-222 and geochemical signature of groundwater. Our results indicate that the highest radon-222 levels in streamflow, i.e., closest to groundwater levels, are observed in the headwaters of Sagehen Creek, and these levels increase over the course of the snowmelt season. Continuing work will characterize the evolution of the proportion of groundwater contribution to streamflow as it approaches baseflow conditions.
